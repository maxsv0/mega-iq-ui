## Production server
Local end-point URL: 
* https://www.mega-iq.com (English)
* https://es.mega-iq.com (Español) - ONLINE
* https://ru.mega-iq.com (Русский) - ONLINE
* https://de.mega-iq.com (Deutsch)

## Development server

No separate development environment right now.

### Local development

To setup local development environment:
* Set locale value in the file `src/environments/app-locale.ts`. Possible values: `en`, `es`, `de`, `ru`
* Set the value of `apiUrl` and `apiKey` in the file `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`
* (only for run without SSR) Set the value of `apiUrl` and `apiKey` in the file `src/environments/environment.ts`
* Build app, for example, for English run `npm run build:ssr:en` 
* Run the SSR app `npm run serve:ssr`
* Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`.
    
Another option is to run without SSR `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Build Angular application 

Build application 
* For `EN` locale run `npm run build:ssr:en`
* For `RU` locale run `npm run build:ssr:ru`
* For `ES` locale run `npm run build:ssr:es`
* For `DE` locale run `npm run build:ssr:de`

Dont' forget to change value of `APP_LOCALE_ID` and `apiUrl` before running
a build to an appropriate locale value.

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
The browser app directory is `dist/browser` and a server-side app directory is `dist/server`.

Dont' forget to change locale value in the file `src/environments/app-locale.ts` before running a build.

Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests.
